# 739. Daily Temperatures
Given an array of integers temperatures represents the daily temperatures, return an array answer such that answer[i] is the number of days you have to wait after the ith day to get a warmer temperature. If there is no future day for which this is possible, keep answer[i] == 0 instead.


Example 1:
```
Input: temperatures = [73,74,75,71,69,72,76,73]
Output: [1,1,4,2,1,1,0,0]
```

Example 2:
```
Input: temperatures = [30,40,50,60]
Output: [1,1,1,0]
```
Example 3:
```
Input: temperatures = [30,60,90]
Output: [1,1,0]
```

Constraints:

+ 1 <= temperatures.length <= 105
+ 30 <= temperatures[i] <= 100

# Solutions
Use monotone stack to confirm the next larger element.

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] dailyTemperatures(int[] temperatures) {
        
        int n = temperatures.length;
        int[] result = new int[n];
        
        Stack<Integer> NGEStack = new Stack<Integer>();

        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++ ) {

            while(!NGEStack.isEmpty() 
                    && temperatures[NGEStack.peek()] < temperatures[i]) {
                
                int prevI = NGEStack.pop();
                result[prevI] = i - prevI;
            }
            /**
             * current element is smaller than that at the top of stack, 
             * so push it into stack.
             */
            NGEStack.push(i);
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```
