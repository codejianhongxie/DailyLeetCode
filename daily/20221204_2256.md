# 2256. Minimum Average Difference

You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums of length n.

The average difference of the index i is the absolute difference between the average of the first i + 1 elements of nums and the average of the last n - i - 1 elements. Both averages should be rounded down to the nearest integer.

Return the index with the minimum average difference. If there are multiple such indices, return the smallest one.

Note:

+ The absolute difference of two numbers is the absolute value of their difference.
+ The average of n elements is the sum of the n elements divided (integer division) by n.
+ The average of 0 elements is considered to be 0.
 

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [2,5,3,9,5,3]
Output: 3
Explanation:
- The average difference of index 0 is: |2 / 1 - (5 + 3 + 9 + 5 + 3) / 5| = |2 / 1 - 25 / 5| = |2 - 5| = 3.
- The average difference of index 1 is: |(2 + 5) / 2 - (3 + 9 + 5 + 3) / 4| = |7 / 2 - 20 / 4| = |3 - 5| = 2.
- The average difference of index 2 is: |(2 + 5 + 3) / 3 - (9 + 5 + 3) / 3| = |10 / 3 - 17 / 3| = |3 - 5| = 2.
- The average difference of index 3 is: |(2 + 5 + 3 + 9) / 4 - (5 + 3) / 2| = |19 / 4 - 8 / 2| = |4 - 4| = 0.
- The average difference of index 4 is: |(2 + 5 + 3 + 9 + 5) / 5 - 3 / 1| = |24 / 5 - 3 / 1| = |4 - 3| = 1.
- The average difference of index 5 is: |(2 + 5 + 3 + 9 + 5 + 3) / 6 - 0| = |27 / 6 - 0| = |4 - 0| = 4.
The average difference of index 3 is the minimum average difference so return 3.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [0]
Output: 0
Explanation:
The only index is 0 so return 0.
The average difference of index 0 is: |0 / 1 - 0| = |0 - 0| = 0.
```

Constraints:

+ 1 <= nums.length <= 105
+ 0 <= nums[i] <= 105


# Solution
This kind of problem is very routine is to use prefix sum:
Preprocessing an array in advance, prefixSum[i] stands for sum{num[0]... nums[i]}
Then if we ask for the sum of elements between i and j, sum[i,j] = prefixSum[j] - prefixSum[i-1].
Note a little that the sum of the whole array may be too large, exceeding the max value of int, so use Long to save.

```java
class Solution {
    public int minimumAverageDifference(int[] nums) {
        
        int n = nums.length;
        long[] prefixSum = new long[n];
        // Calculate prefix sum array.
        prefixSum[0] = nums[0];
        for(int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            prefixSum[i] = prefixSum[i-1] + Long.valueOf(nums[i]);
        }

        int result = 0;
        long minDiff = Long.MAX_VALUE;
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            long leftSum = prefixSum[i] / (i+1);
            long rightSum = (n-i-1) != 0 ? (prefixSum[n-1] - prefixSum[i])/(n-i-1) : 0;
            long diff = Math.abs(leftSum - rightSum);
            if (diff < minDiff) {
                minDiff = diff;
                result = i;
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```
