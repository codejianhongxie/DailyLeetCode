# 2225. Find Players With Zero or One Losses

You are given an integer array matches where matches[i] = [winneri, loseri] indicates that the player winneri defeated player loseri in a match.

Return a list answer of size 2 where:

answer[0] is a list of all players that have not lost any matches.
answer[1] is a list of all players that have lost exactly one match.
The values in the two lists should be returned in increasing order.

Note:

You should only consider the players that have played at least one match.
The testcases will be generated such that no two matches will have the same outcome.
 

Example 1:
```
Input: matches = [[1,3],[2,3],[3,6],[5,6],[5,7],[4,5],[4,8],[4,9],[10,4],[10,9]]
Output: [[1,2,10],[4,5,7,8]]
Explanation:
Players 1, 2, and 10 have not lost any matches.
Players 4, 5, 7, and 8 each have lost one match.
Players 3, 6, and 9 each have lost two matches.
Thus, answer[0] = [1,2,10] and answer[1] = [4,5,7,8].
```

Example 2:
```
Input: matches = [[2,3],[1,3],[5,4],[6,4]]
Output: [[1,2,5,6],[]]
Explanation:
Players 1, 2, 5, and 6 have not lost any matches.
Players 3 and 4 each have lost two matches.
Thus, answer[0] = [1,2,5,6] and answer[1] = [].
```

Constraints:

* 1 <= matches.length <= 105
* matches[i].length == 2
* 1 <= winneri, loseri <= 105
* winneri != loseri
* All matches[i] are unique.

# Solution
Use a map to record the number of times each person loses, and then traverse the map to get the people who have not lost and who have lost once.

```Java
class Solution {
    public List<List<Integer>> findWinners(int[][] matches) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> loseCount = new HashMap<Integer, Integer>();
        for(int[] player : matches) {
            int winner = player[0];
            int loser = player[1];
            loseCount.put(winner, loseCount.getOrDefault(winner, 0));
            loseCount.put(loser, loseCount.getOrDefault(loser,0) + 1);
        }
        List<List<Integer>> result = new ArrayList<>();
        result.add(new ArrayList<Integer>());
        result.add(new ArrayList<Integer>());
        for(Map.Entry<Integer, Integer> entry: loseCount.entrySet()) {
            if (entry.getValue() == 0) {
                result.get(0).add(entry.getKey());
            }
            if (entry.getValue() == 1) {
                result.get(1).add(entry.getKey());
            }
        }
        Collections.sort(result.get(0));
        Collections.sort(result.get(1));
        return result;        
    }
}
```
